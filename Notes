Notes about flow and patterns

1. Login

Login is done by authenticating user first then depending on the status returned (200, 400, 404, etc...)
the program will direct GUI to appropriate UI and load user data from database

2. Registration

Data will be entered by user then sent to data base first, then Data will be loaded into the object itself.

Reason for this is that sending data to database successfully is important, the User if allowed to use program
with data not yet entered in Database can cause logistical issues.

3. Update

Everytime something is sent update will get all data from database

4. Slot

Slot will show the appointments in all days of the month by getting the date NOW from outside the class and passing
that date into the instance in a loop that goes for as long as the month is

It will get appointments by looping months, to days, to slot number to see if it equals, if it does it will set
appointment.

Slot will go in database to get the appointment related to it
